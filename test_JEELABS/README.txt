Jeelabs/OEM compatible channel was just added to OTRadioLink library.

The purpose of this sketch is to show how to use it (on REV2 or REV9 boards) to talk to devices that use Jeelabsi library.  It can be configured to either listen or send. To select one you want, please  comment or uncomment '#define RECEIVERi' line.  

Please note that in order to build this sketch you wil need OTRadioLink library branch TODO-784 (https://github.com/opentrv/OTRadioLink/tree/TODO-784).
